# Geographic Data Partitioner

This is a GIS data partitioner built in Rust, aiming to partition large geospatial data files into more manageable files suitable for analysis. 

Input can be one or more GeoJSON files, and the output will be multiple GeoJSON files depending on extent and size of original data.
